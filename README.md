# Title: ATM

Description: This exercise uses React and Babel to create an interactive ATM that allows you to use deposit and withdrawl buttons to add and remove funds from the account. Using React hooks allows the ATM to keep track of the state of the account and if you are depositing or withdrawling.

How To Run: go to https://jmobarry.github.io/ATM/ Click on Deposit and type in a number to add money to the account. Click on Cash back and enter a number to withdrawl that amount.

Roadmap: Add a red text notification that pops up if overdrawing instead of an alert.
